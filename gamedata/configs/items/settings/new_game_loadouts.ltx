;; modified for Respawn Mode

;; ===========================< Loadout >=============================
;; To add items in the item lists:
;; -------------------------------
;; add a new line: "item_section			= value_1,value_2,value3" under the correct section below
;; "item_section": is the section name of the your item. NOTE: don't make lines with the same "item_section", only the last one will be read
;; "value_1": (boolean  value, must be true or false) determines wether this item should be added to player's inventory list (false) or to the loadout pick list (true)
;; "value_2": (number) the amount of the said item
;; "value_3": (number) how many points it requires
;; "value_4": (number) what progression difficulty is this item locked at (2 means it's available for difficulty 1 and 2) [no value means its available for all difficulties]
;; ========================================================
;; put your custom items under "custom" section, they will always appear to pick from
;; NOTE: you will get a single bolt only no matter how many you put in here, due to technical engine reasons
